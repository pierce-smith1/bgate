# The Billy Gate

The Billy Gate opens a world of lies. The Window will show you his deception.

## Usage

You must enter the `#gate-control` channel to control the Billy Gate. All
messages in this channel will be interpreted as commands. For regular human
discussion, the `#gate-chat` channel is provided to you.

You may control the mouse and keyboard of the Gate. This will now be explained.

### Seize The Keyboard

To control the keyboard, send a message containing the name of the key you wish
to press. For instance, should I send the message

`a`

The a key would be pressed in the Gate. To press multiple keys at once, write
each of the keys you wish to press as a space or plus-separated list, as such:

`s n p`

or

`s+n+p`

The following special words are recognized as unique keys by the Gate:

- `tab`
- `space`
- `left`
- `right`
- `down`
- `up`
- `windows` | `super`
- `ctrl`
- `alt`
- `shift`
- `capslock`
- `del` | `delete`
- `backspace`
- `pgup` | `pageup`
- `pgdn` | `pgdown` | `pagedown`

They can also be used in multi-key sequences:

`shift+a+del`

### Seize The Mouse

You will also send messages to control the mouse.

Send `click` or `leftclick` to use the left mouse button. Send `rightclick` to
use the right mouse button.

Send `to x y` to *transport* the mouse to a specific location. This location is
measured in pixels, relative to the bottom left corner of the screen. If the
location you wish to send the mouse to is out of the bounds of the Gate's
screen, you have failed.

Send `move x y` to *push* the mouse by a certain amount. `x` and `y` are
measured in pixels. Positive `x` moves the mouse right, negative `x` moves it
left. Positive `y` moves the mouse up, negative `y` moves it down. Again, should
the mouse leave the screen of the Gate, you have failed.

### Command Is Limited

You may only send five commands every thirty seconds. Should you attempt to send
more, you shall be shamed, and your entire query will fail.

### You Are Undirected

If you must ask what to do in the Gate, you have already lost your way. The Gate
is for you to explore. Forge your own path.

The Gate will remain open until an undetermined time in the future. If you
cannot quell your questions by then, they shall remain open between the jaws of
time for eternity.

Remember that he Lies. Hold your reason. Mine has been lost long ago.
